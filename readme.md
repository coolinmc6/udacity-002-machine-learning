## Lesson #2: Naive Bayes

- **Decision Surface** is that line on the scatterplot that allows you to pick
which "type" a new data point more closely matches (e.g. red X's or blue O's)
  - if it's a straight line, we say that it's a **linear** decision surface
- what your ML algorithm does is it takes all of your data and creates a DS
(decision surface) so that with future data, you can make a determination as to
whether it is a red X or blue O
